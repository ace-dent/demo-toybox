# Notes

## Artwork

Start - Hacking away with Affinity Designer to try and make some tiling version of the NOVA logo.
13:00 After the challenge to convert the vector logo into 8x8px tile artwork, we can start to create and test a til  eset using [Pulp](https://play.date/pulp/) for PlayDate.  
13:08 So far the `N` takes 6 tiles.  
14:00 Adding down slopes for `V` and `A`, now at 9 tiles.  
14:15 All tiles done. Cheaky re-use of one (adds 2x junk pixels), saves a tile. Giving total 15 (x8 --> ~120 bytes). `O` is still to be drawn. Plan was using a circle, but perhaps could be tiles if there's room at the end...? Now need to get something in PICO-8.  
14:35 Use ImageMagick to slice up Pulp export into individual tiles.  
15:26 Back to Pulp to try tweaking the logo design a little, for thinner horizontal lines.  


## Coding

14:45 Repurposing a bash script to convert png tiles into P8 code snippets  
15:05 We have an `N`! ðŸŽ‰  
15:12 Drawing full tileset logo in P8. Concern is that the print code takes 74chrs (unoptimized). Perhaps I should have stored artwork at half-height and then doubled on rendering...?  
15:24 Playing around with P8 font modifier [effects](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/P8SCII_Control_Codes#Changing_character_rendering_modes). Not sure I like the thicker horizontal lines in the artwork.
