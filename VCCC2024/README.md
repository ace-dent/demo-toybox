# Vintage Computing Christmas Challenge 2024

The Vintage Computing Christmas Challenge (VCCC / VC³) is a size coding challenge for retro computers. Details [here](https://www.logiker.com/Vintage-Computing-Christmas-Challenge-2024). This year's challenge is to draw a Christmas present 🎁 in ASCII characters, with minimal code.

## Information theory

The ASCII art is 19 characters wide (1+8+1+8+1) and 20 characters high (1+1+8+1+8+1). Allowing for a new line symbol on each row, gives 20 x 20 x 1 byte per character; directly encoding the image as a text file requires 400 bytes. 

We can do a little better by removing the trailing whitespace on the first row, after the bow 🎀 . 

```text 
␠_␠_␠_␠_\o/␤
```

The first line can be reduced from 20 to 12 characters (8 spaces, 3 characters and 1 new line).  Additionally, we don't need a newline on the final row. This reduces the direct encoding by 9 bytes to **391 bytes** ([ascii.txt](./assets/ascii.txt)).

We can see there are duplicated structures in both x- and y-directions. Hopefully this redundancy can be exploited in our program. To get a measure of the actual _information_ content, we can use `xz` to produce a compressed LZMA stream without a container format.

```bash
xz --compress --keep --format=raw -9 -e --suffix=.lzma ascii.txt
```

This gives us a file of 34 bytes or 272 bits. For essentially 364 symbols (19*19 +3), each symbol has on average ~0.8 bits of information. The low bit rate is due to the limited symbols `" +-!\o/"` and the repeating patterns.

We can also estimate the information content, by encoding as a PNG image. This file format exploits x-/y-repetition with [delta filtering](https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG-Filters.html) as a first step in compression. Each ASCII character can be stored as a greyscale value (1 byte per pixel) in a bitmap image of 19x20 pixels ([here](assets/bitmap.png)). To help visualise this, it is easier to look at an enlarged, colourised version:

<img width="128" height="128" src="assets/bitmap-color.png" alt="">

<small>(Whitespace `␠` 0x20; Red `!` 0x21; Green `-` 0x2D; Purple `+` 0x2B; Blue `\` 0x5C; Orange `o` 0x6F; Teal `/` 0x2F).</small>

The optimised PNG file is 90 bytes, but contains the overhead of a container format. The actual bitmap data stored in the `IDAT` chunk is just 33 bytes. This is inline with our result using LZMA.

Since our code must have some overhead for rendering and decoding, an absolute minimum is likely to be ~ **40 bytes** for a program.

## Main entry (PICO-8)

Although the competition targets 'vintage' computers, fantasy console entries are allowed.

My main entry is rendered using PICO-8 print statements with some crafty P8SCII control characters [(1)](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/P8SCII_Control_Codes)[(2)](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/P8SCII).

```lua
--vccc2024 in 66 chars
--by ace-dent
?"³♥\\o/"
for ♥=0,18do?({"+¹8-+¹8-+","!³♥!³♥!"})[min(♥%9,1)+1]
end
```

Downloadable rom file is [here](vccc2024.p8.rom) (66 bytes).

## Wild entry – 'Pressie'

I wanted to run with the gift theme. Some P8SCII to unwrap. (Use 'punycode' mode if copy & pasting! <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>).

```lua
--pressie in 76 chars
--by ace-dent
?[[⁶c1⁶p

	⁶.0Pナ~◝kミw⁶.⁶⁵³?○s{s
	⁶.◝U◝gワg◝~⁶.○U○s{s○?⁶!5f2c³]],-rnd(3)
run()
```

Downloadable rom file is [here](wild-entry/pressie.p8.rom) (76 bytes).

This is a tiny 'Pressie', with a flashing Christmas light effect. Entirely rendered in one print statement, this screen filling bitmap takes 76 characters. Note: the `run()` loop executes very tightly, so it may take a few attempts to <kbd>escape</kbd> the program.

## PICO-8 - devlog

Testing done with [PXAViz](https://carlc27843.itch.io/pico-8-source-compression-visualizer) and 

Avoid `cls()`, as this is hot on PXA. Escape the slash `\\`.

### 1. Naive approach

Compression using - `EXPORT -T VCCC2024.P8.ROM`  Exporting a code-only compressed file
is possible since version 0.2.4.c

```lua
?"        \\o/"
?"+--------+--------+"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"+--------+--------+"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"!        !        !"
?"+--------+--------+"
-- 452 chars / 56 bytes PXA compressed
```

### 2. Less naive approach

Can we help the PXA compression a little? Sure! We can combine all the rows into a multi-line print statement, to avoid some overhead of the duplicated `?"..."` wrapper.

```lua
?[[        \o/
+--------+--------+
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
+--------+--------+
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
!        !        !
+--------+--------+]]
-- 396 chars / 53 bytes PXA compressed
```

I think 53 bytes represents the best we can do with PXA compression and is close to the 40 byte minimum I specified... BUT!... The VCCC competition rules exclude the use of these built in file compressors, to level the playing field and encourage some *actual* coding!


### 3. Coding patterns

Ok, first effort to code something.  
Exploit repetitions in the symbols.

```lua
h="+\*8-+\*8-+"
v="!\*8 !\*8 !"
?"\*8 \\o/"
?h
for i=1,8do?v
end?h
for i=1,8do?v
end?h
-- 86 chars / 61 bytes PXA compressed
```
Increased entropy, as PXA compression becomes less effective from 53 to 61 bytes.

### 4. Hacking with PETSCII

Multiple characters.  
Replace spaces with horizontal offsets.  
Combine some lines of the for loop to avoid whitespace.

```lua
h="+¹8-+¹8-+"v="!³♥!³♥!"
?"³♥\\o/"
?h
for j=1,2do for i=1,8do?v
end?h
end
-- 73 chars / 68 bytes PXA compressed
```

### 5. Packing with tables

```lua
o={"+¹8-+¹8-+","!³♥!³♥!"}?"³♥\\o/"
for n=0,18do?o[min(n%9,1)+1]
end
-- 67 chars / 72 bytes PXA compressed
```
Using tables and single for loop.

### 6. Last byte

```lua
?"³♥\\o/"
for n=0,18do?({"+¹8-+¹8-+","!³♥!³♥!"})[min(n%9,1)+1]
end
-- 66 chars / 73 bytes PXA compressed
```
-1 chr directly assign table.  
This is the best solution I could achieve. In experimenting with more complex schemes, the overhead was too great.

### 7. Bonus: Fancy printing

Using the 'forbidden' [palette](https://nerdyteachers.com/PICO-8/Guide/?PALETTES), which provides a nice colour ramp going from `-1` to `-8`.  
Add pauses for a teletype effect.

```lua
cls()
h="⁶d1+¹8-+¹8-+"v="!³♥!³♥⁶d2!"
?"³♥\\o/"
?h
for f=1,2do for f=1,8do?v,-f
end?h
end
```
